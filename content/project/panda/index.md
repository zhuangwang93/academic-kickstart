summary = "Panda emulates shortest job first (SJF) scheduling to optimize the average flow completion time for throughput-intensive applications on the premise that flow information is not known a priori. Also, it bounds low latency for delay-sensitive applications by leveraging the distinct flow size distributions of the two kinds of applications."
