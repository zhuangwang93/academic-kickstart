I am a first-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Rice University, working with [Prof. Ang Chen](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~angchen/). My research interests include computer networks and distributed systems. Before joining Rice, I received M.E degree from ICT, CAS, advised by [Prof. Mingyu Chen](http://asg.ict.ac.cn/cmy) and Prof. Ke Liu.
